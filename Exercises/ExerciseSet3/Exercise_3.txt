Exercise 3.1

This would be problematic as after the first clause is satisfied (descend(X,Y):-child(X,Y)) 
then the second clause will just recursively call itself with an arbitrary variable
with each nesting of recursion generating a new variable (z1, z2, z3 ....), where 
this variable becomes the first thing in the knowledge base that statisfies the clause.
in this case it will be the first two things that satisfies child(X,Y).
